# Digital Journal

**Digital Journal** is a journal designed for your computer. Document significant events and memories, find entries with a search bar, and view and edit them later. This was created in Godot, a game engine similar to Unity which uses a Python-lite backend programming language.

# Current Features

- Add new memories (journal entries)
 - Memories contain a mandatory name and date and optional location, description, tags, and media (photos and videos). Use "Tab" to easily change between text fields, and drag and drop media from your computer into the program to add them.
- Preview memories
 - The home screen displays a list of current memories and their name, date, location, description, how long ago they occurred, and media.
- Search for memories
 - The user can narrow down to specific memories using the search bar (case insensitive). Memories can be found by typing their name, date, location, or any of their tags. Multiple search parameters can be used by separating keywords with a space.

# Development

This is the foremost project I am working on. Expect frequent updates until all of the planned features are added in. Also, please excuse the boot splash and project icon. This was designed as an anniversary gift to my girlfriend. In the final release version I will be sure to change these to make the project more generic.
